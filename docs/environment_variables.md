# Environment variables

We'll make ample and implicit use of environment variables in this software. Much of it should be self-explanatory; environment variables (or references to them) are not included in the Hydra configs for security reasons. Here are a list of required environment variables that each type of AI will need to run successfully.

**Open AI**
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`

**Azure Open AI**
- `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`
